## üìå Project Overview

Standardized tests such as the SAT play a crucial role in shaping academic opportunities for high school students across the U.S.  
This project analyzes **New York City (NYC) public school SAT scores** to identify patterns of academic performance using **SQL queries in Python via SQLite and Pandas**.

Key SAT components analyzed include:

- **Math** (Max score: 800)
- **Reading** (Max score: 800)
- **Writing** (Max score: 800)

This project uses **SQL for querying** and **Pandas** for data processing and visualization, uncovering trends among high-performing schools and highlighting borough-based educational inequalities.

## üéØ Objective

To analyze SAT scores from NYC public schools and uncover:

- Which schools score highest in SAT Math
- The top 10 schools based on total SAT scores
- Which borough has the greatest SAT score variation
- Borough-level performance gaps and trends
