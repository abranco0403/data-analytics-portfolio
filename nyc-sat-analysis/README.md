## 📌 Project Overview

Standardized tests such as the SAT play a crucial role in shaping academic opportunities for high school students across the U.S.  
This project analyzes **New York City (NYC) public school SAT scores** to identify patterns of academic performance using **SQL queries in Python via SQLite and Pandas**.

Key SAT components analyzed include:

- **Math** (max score: 800)
- **Reading** (max score: 800)
- **Writing** (max score: 800)

This project uses **SQL for querying** and **Pandas** for final transformations and presentation, offering insights into top-performing schools and borough-level performance disparities.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify the NYC public schools with the highest SAT scores and analyze borough-level trends in total SAT performance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **SQLite** for SQL querying
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and documentation

## 📈 Key Findings

### 📊 Best Math Results
- Schools with average math scores above **640** (80% of 800) were flagged as top performers.
- These schools exhibit exceptional quantitative proficiency among students.

### 🥇 Top 10 Total SAT Scores
- Schools were ranked based on the combined total of **Math + Reading + Writing** scores.
- The top 10 schools demonstrate balanced excellence across all tested areas.

### 🗽 Borough with Highest SAT Score Variation
- One borough stood out with the **highest standard deviation** in total SAT scores.
- This reveals **significant performance disparities** within that borough, signaling the need for targeted educational interventions.

## 📈 Overall Insights

Analyzing SAT results at the school and borough level reveals stark differences in student performance across NYC.  
While some schools consistently excel across all areas, others show gaps—particularly in math or overall preparedness.

Policymakers, educators, and parents can use this data to:

- Promote resource allocation to underperforming schools.
- Highlight success strategies from top performers.
- Inform families considering school options in NYC.
