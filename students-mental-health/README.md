## 📌 Project Overview

Studying abroad offers exciting opportunities but also unique challenges, especially related to mental health. This project analyzes a 2018 dataset from a Japanese international university to explore how the **length of stay abroad** impacts the mental well-being of international students.

Key mental health indicators studied include:

- **Depression** (PHQ-9 test)
- **Social Connectedness** (SCS test)
- **Acculturative Stress** (ASISS test)

The analysis uses **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** to clean, aggregate, and visualize data, highlighting patterns relevant to student support and wellbeing.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how mental health scores change relative to the length of stay abroad and to identify factors that could inform support programs for international students.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for workflow and presentation

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### Depression (PHQ-9) Scores
- New international students (stay < 1 year) exhibit **higher depression scores**.
- Depression tends to **decrease with longer stays**, indicating improved adaptation over time.

### Social Connectedness (SCS)
- Social connectedness is **lowest among recent arrivals**.
- It **increases with length of stay**, reflecting stronger social ties and belonging.

### Acculturative Stress (ASISS)
- Acculturative stress is **highest for students who have just arrived**.
- Stress levels generally **decline as students spend more time abroad**.

---

## 📈 Overall Insights

Length of stay is a significant factor affecting mental health outcomes. New arrivals face greater risks of depression and stress, likely due to cultural adjustment challenges and limited social networks.  
These findings suggest that universities should focus on **early social integration and mental health support** to improve international students’ wellbeing.
